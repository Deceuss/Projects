# Projects
This repository contains Various Projects from My Open Colleges Diploma and some that I completed in my free time

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ACMEInsurance
The following folders and files contain the code I wrote in the Projects/ACMEInsurance/ACMEInsurance directory:
- Business Logic Layer (folder)
- Presentation Layer (folder)
- Dataaccess Layer (folder)
- GlobalVariables.cs (file)

This application interfaced with a local SQL database (this file is in the folder).
The application allows the user to manipulate the SQL database through a User Interface.
The user can add, update, delete and search for database entries, and all custome SQL 
queries (some functions required more bespoke, specific queries rather than a general saved 
querie) are handled by the application, allowing anyone to use it, not just SQL savy programmers.

This application was one of the larger applications I wrote during my diploma, this project took
around 2-3 weeks (approximately) in total.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Calculator (Completed in my free time)
This is a simple calculator application, the user can enter integers by pressing the keys on 
the application. 
The application will accept two integer values;
- When a user presses a key for a mathematical opperation, the number in the display is saved
- The user then enters the second number, and presses the equals key (all opperation keys 
are disabled after pressing once), and the resulting value is displayed to the user.

This application took approximately 1.5-2 hours to build

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TaxCalculator
This application calculates tax based on a set of rates found in the 'rates.txt' file.
The user fills out the required fields, specifiying wether they are an employee or a contractor.
The program will calculate the tax, and output that data along with the details of the employee 
or contractor to a pdf file.

This application took 3 days to build (approximately 15-20 hours in total)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WeatherApp
This app displays the weatehr for Cities in AUstralia, it allows the user to select a a city, and 
then fetches the relevant, up to date weather data using an API from OpenWeatherMap.
It was developed for android using Xamarin Forms.

This application took approximately 5 hours.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ContactsManager
The ContactsManager app uses an XML document to populate various contact information, the app 
allows the user to update or delete a contact entry. The XML document is loaded as an android asset,
when the app runs for the first time, it will make a copy of the XML document in personal storage so 
that it is writeable and changes that a made during runtime can be saved.

The training material provided by Open Colleges was incorrect, and so I was forced to figure out how to 
read files from android assets and write to a new file. While the fact the course content was wrong 
was indeed frustrating, it was enjoyable and reqarding to teach myself what to do.

# Others
There are more projects, but as those projects required me to edit or add to existing code, they are
not uploaded here as they are not entirely my work. An example of such a project was a book tracking 
application for a Library, the scenario was that the developer working on the software had quit, and I 
was tasked with completing the application, this required me to write pseudocode, desk check the 
pseudocode, and then insert that functionality into the existing application. If you would like to 
see that work, please contact me.
