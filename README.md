# Projects
This repository contains Various Projects from My Open Colleges Diploma and some that I completed in my free time

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ACMEInsurance
This application interfaced with a local SQL database (this file is in the folder).
The application allows the user to manipulate the SQL database through a User Interface.
The user can add, update, delete and search for database entries, and all custome SQL 
queries (some functions required more bespoke, specific queries rather than a general saved 
querie) are handled by the application, allowing anyone to use it, not just SQL savy programmers.

This application was one of the larger applications I wrote during my diploma, this project took
around 2-3 weeks (approximately) in total.

# Calculator (Completed in my free time)
This is a simple calculator application, the user can enter integers by pressing the keys on 
the application. 
The application will accept two integer values;
- When a user presses a key for a mathematical opperation, the number in the display is saved
- The user then enters the second number, and presses the equals key (all opperation keys 
are disabled after pressing once), and the resulting value is displayed to the user.

This application took approximately 1.5-2 hours to build

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TaxCalculator
This application calculates tax based on a set of rates found in the 'rates.txt' file.
The user fills out the required fields, specifiying wether they are an employee or a contractor.
The program will calculate the tax, and output that data along with the details of the employee 
or contractor to a pdf file.

This application took 3 days to build (approximately 15-20 hours in total)

# Others
There are more projects, but as those projects required me to edit or add to existing code, they are
not uploaded here as they are not entirely my work. An example of such a project was a book tracking 
application for a Library, the scenario was that the developer working on the software had quit, and I 
was tasked with completing the application, this required me to write pseudocode, desk check the 
pseudocode, and then insert that functionality into the existing application. If you would like to 
see that work, please contact me.
